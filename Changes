- The web service client API has been updated for the v2.1 release of the web
  service. In particular, the city_isp_org and omni methods on
  GeoIP2::WebService::Client should be considered deprecated. The city method
  now provides all of the data formerly provided by city_isp_org, and the omni
  method has been replaced by the insights method.

- Explicitly import the B module when we use it. This didn't break on our Perl
  but broke elsewhere. Reported by Wes Young. GitHub PR #3.

- Any webservice response with boolean values in the response caused a type
  error to be thrown.

- Updated the docs to mention the MaxMind::DB::Reader::XS module.

- Renamed the languages constructor parameter to locales for both the Client
  and Reader classes.

- Added the GeoIP2::Database::Reader class. This provides an API for looking
  up data in a GeoIP2 database, as opposed to making a web service call.

- Switched the version number scheme to X.YYYZZZ.

- If an IP address is not found, whether for a web service call or in a
  downloaded database, the code always throws a
  GeoIP2::Error::IPAddressNotFound exception.

- Make the license section of the docs match the LICENSE file in the repo. We
  meant to use "same as Perl 5" everywhere.

- The first official beta release of this API.

- Allow IPv6 addresses to be passed to the GeoIP2::WebService::Client class's
  methods.

- We now support more languages. The new languages are de, es, fr, and pt-BR.

- Postal code data is now returned as a separate top-level object. We now
  provide a GeoIP2::Record::Postal class for this data.

- The REST API returns a record with data about your account. There is a new
  GeoIP2::Record::MaxMind class for this data.

- Fixed bug in the City & CityISPOrg classes. Their subdivions() method was
  not working.

- Type constraint errors are now thrown as GeoIP2::Type::Error objects.
